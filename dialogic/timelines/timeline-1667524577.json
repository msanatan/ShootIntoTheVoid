Unfortunately, there isn’t enough fuel to warp out of this system. The only option is to reroute all power to the main cannon for one last\npiercing shot to take out all enemy ships. The problem is if we do this, our sensors will die in a few seconds, so you’ll be shooting blind. It’s our only hope to get out of here in one piece!"
